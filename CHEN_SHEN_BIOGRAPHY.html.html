    	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
    	<p>
    		I lived in 4 different cities in 2 different countries so far. Toronto is my favourite city so far and I love the mountains in the west Canada. I miss home too, but I am not ready to come home yet.
            Grew up in China’s hype growth years were exciting and strange, everything I knew as a kid was basically gone by the time I left the country. I often wondered, if I will fit in China now. I studied Sociology and Political Science in the University of Alberta and spent my free time in participating in students' organizations, hiking in the mountains and doing other fun things. The best part of west Canada was the mountains, the Rocky is unbelievably beautiful, especially off the beaten path. Hot tourists’ spots are definitely worth a while, but to see the true beauty, one must go where less has been. Funny thing, grew up I was a total indoors’ man, I did not become outdoorsy until recently, but it was one of the best decision I have ever made, the amount of s’more I ate on backpacking trips alone was worth the comfort I left back home. Shortly after I graduated from the university I moved to Toronto and who knows where else I will go.
